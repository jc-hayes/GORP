# GORP
Purpose:

GORP uses augmented reality (AR) and global positioning system (GPS), so users can create and share custom paths rendered as three dimensional (3D) shapes through the phone’s camera. Unlike map-based apps, GORP utilizes relative location to provide higher position accuracy, without the need of cell-data or Wi-Fi.

Target Audience:
• Outdoor Enthusiasts: These are the ideal and primary users, since this app doesn’t need a data connection to be used it is ideal for anyone in the backcountry. 

• Pedestrians: The map mode would allow pedestrians to download routes prior to them arriving in a location. It also allows for people walking around to lay a route so that they can always find their way back. 

• Event Attendees: On your way from the car to the event/festival center, you can turn on the lay route mode. Then, on the way back to your car, turn on the AR mode to find your way back to the car.
